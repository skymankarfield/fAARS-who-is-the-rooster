# performOperationByObjectKey
This API allows to set values and apply operations over the game-developer-created set of attributes that are specified
in the "attributes" section of the JSON file when a new Game-Object is created.
This API allows to modify only those attributes of a Game-Object that are specified in the "attributes" section of 
a Game-Object.
In order to directly modify the automatically inherited set of attributes outside the "attributes" section of a 
Game-Object, please refer to the [Game Manager] set of APIs.
